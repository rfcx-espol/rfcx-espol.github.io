# UnityWebGLAudioVisualizer

UnityWebGLAudioVisualizer is a Web based real time audio visualizer for Espol's Protected Forest live sensoring project, which was possible through the collaboration with Telef√≥nica S.A. 

This module is developed in Unity3D and is using C# for it's source code, and it's also using JavaScript integration through unity jslib plugin so that it can communicate with the web browser processing. 

You can check the documentation and inner workings of the Visualizer on it's [wiki](https://github.com/rfcx-espol/UnityWebGLAudioVisualizer/wiki).

This repository is just for the visualizer module, and it's only part of a bigger project which is hosted at rfcx-espol GitHub User.
